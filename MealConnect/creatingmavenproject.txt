Steps to Create a Maven-based Spring Project using Spring Initializr
1. Access Spring Initializr
Visit the Spring Initializr website to start creating your project.

2. Configure Project Metadata
Project: Choose "Maven Project".
Language: Select "Java".
Spring Boot: Choose a stable version of Spring Boot.
Group: Specify your project's group identifier (e.g., com.example).
Artifact: Specify your project's artifact identifier (e.g., spring-demo).
Name: Enter a name for your project.
Description: Optionally provide a description for your project.
Package Name: Specify the base package name for your project (e.g., com.example.springdemo).
Packaging: Select "Jar" or "War" as per your deployment needs.
Java Version: Choose the Java version you want to use (e.g., 11, 17).
Dependencies: Select dependencies you need for your project (e.g., "Spring Web", "Spring Data JPA", "Thymeleaf" for web applications).
3. Generate Project
Click on the "Generate" button to download a zip file containing your Maven-based Spring project configured with your selected dependencies.

4. Import into IDE
Unzip the downloaded project archive.
Import the project into your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
5. Build and Run
Build your project using Maven:
bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
Run your Spring Boot application:
bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
Alternatively, you can run the application directly from your IDE by running the main class (usually annotated with @SpringBootApplication).
Example Scenario
Let's create a basic Maven-based Spring Boot project with Spring Web and Thymeleaf dependencies.

Project Metadata:
Group: com.example
Artifact: spring-demo
Name: Spring Demo Project
Description: A simple Spring Boot demo project
Package Name: com.example.springdemo
Dependencies: Spring Web, Thymeleaf
Steps Using Spring Initializr:
Configure Project:

Project: Maven Project
Language: Java
Spring Boot: 2.6.2 (or choose the latest stable version)
Group: com.example
Artifact: spring-demo
Name: Spring Demo Project
Description: A simple Spring Boot demo project
Package Name: com.example.springdemo
Packaging: Jar (default)
Java: 17 (or choose your preferred Java version)
Dependencies: Spring Web, Thymeleaf
Generate Project:

Click on the "Generate" button to download the project zip file.

Import into IDE:

Unzip the downloaded project folder.
Open your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
Import the project as a Maven project:
File -> New -> Project from Existing Sources
Select the unzipped project folder
Choose "Import project from external model" and select "Maven"
Click through the wizard to import the project.
Run the Application:

Navigate to the main class (usually named SpringDemoApplication or similar, annotated with @SpringBootApplication).
Right-click on the main class and select "Run" to start your Spring Boot application.
