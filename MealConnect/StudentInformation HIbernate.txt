Here's how to retrieve student information using Hibernate and print it to the console:

1. Dependencies:

Make sure you have the necessary Hibernate and JPA dependencies in your project's pom.xml (Maven) or build.gradle (Gradle).

2. SessionFactory Bean:

Configure a SessionFactory bean in your Spring configuration to manage Hibernate sessions and connection pooling.

3. Example Code:

Java
@Autowired
private SessionFactory sessionFactory; // Inject SessionFactory bean

public void retrieveStudentInformation(Long studentId) {

  Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
  Transaction transaction = session.beginTransaction();

  try {
    Student student = session.get(Student.class, studentId);

    if (student != null) {
      System.out.println("Student Details:");
      System.out.println("  ID: " + student.getId());
      System.out.println("  Name: " + student.getName());
      System.out.println("  Email: " + student.getEmail());
      // Print other student information as needed
    } else {
      System.out.println("Student with ID " + studentId + " not found.");
    }

    transaction.commit();
  } catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
    transaction.rollback(); // Rollback in case of errors
  } finally {
    session.close();
  }
}
Use code with caution.

Explanation:

The code injects the SessionFactory bean using @Autowired.
It opens a new Hibernate session and starts a transaction.
The session.get(Student.class, studentId) method retrieves the student object with the specified ID from the database.
If the student object is found, its details are printed to the console.
The code handles potential exceptions and ensures the session is closed.
You can call this method from your application to retrieve student information based on specific criteria (e.g., ID, email).
Additional Considerations:

You can use session.createQuery to execute more complex queries and retrieve multiple students based on specific conditions.
Spring Data JPA provides repositories that simplify data access by offering methods like findById or findByEmail.
Remember to properly configure connection pooling and transaction management for efficient and reliable data access.

We assume you have already set up Hibernate, Spring Data JPA, and configured your database connection as per the previous guidance.

Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Define the Entity
Ensure you have a Student entity class annotated with JPA annotations (@Entity, @Table, @Id, @Column, etc.). This class represents the structure of your students table in the database.

java
Copy code
import javax.persistence.*;

@Entity
@Table(name = "students")
public class Student {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @Column(name = "full_name", nullable = false)
    private String fullName;

    @Column(name = "address")
    private String address;

    @Column(name = "gender")
    private String gender;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "course_id")
    private Course course;

    @Column(name = "admission_date")
    private String admissionDate;

    @Column(name = "scholarship")
    private boolean scholarship;

    @Column(name = "hostel_accommodation")
    private boolean hostelAccommodation;

    // Getters and setters (generated or written manually)
}
2. Create a Repository Interface
Define a Spring Data JPA repository interface (StudentRepository) to perform CRUD operations on the Student entity.

java
Copy code
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

public interface StudentRepository extends JpaRepository<Student, Long> {
    // Define custom queries if needed
}
3. Service Layer (Optional)
Create a service class (StudentService) to encapsulate business logic involving the repository. This is optional for simple retrieval operations but can be useful for more complex scenarios.

java
Copy code
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import java.util.List;

@Service
public class StudentService {

    private final StudentRepository studentRepository;

    @Autowired
    public StudentService(StudentRepository studentRepository) {
        this.studentRepository = studentRepository;
    }

    public List<Student> getAllStudents() {
        return studentRepository.findAll();
    }

    // Add more methods as needed (e.g., findById, save, delete, etc.)
}
4. Fetch and Print Student Information
Now, you can fetch student information in your main application, controller, or any other component where you want to print it. For simplicity, let's demonstrate fetching and printing in the main application class.

java
Copy code
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

import java.util.List;

@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

    private final StudentService studentService;

    public Application(StudentService studentService) {
        this.studentService = studentService;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public CommandLineRunner demo() {
        return args -> {
            // Fetch all students
            List<Student> students = studentService.getAllStudents();

            // Print student information
            for (Student student : students) {
                System.out.println("Student ID: " + student.getId());
                System.out.println("Full Name: " + student.getFullName());
                System.out.println("Address: " + student.getAddress());
                System.out.println("Gender: " + student.getGender());
                System.out.println("Course: " + student.getCourse().getName());
                System.out.println("Admission Date: " + student.getAdmissionDate());
                System.out.println("Has Scholarship: " + student.isScholarship());
                System.out.println("Has Hostel Accommodation: " + student.isHostelAccommodation());
                System.out.println();
            }
        };
    }
}
5. Run the Application
Run your Spring Boot application. Hibernate will automatically generate the necessary SQL queries based on your entity mappings and retrieve student information from the database. The information will be printed in the console as specified in the CommandLineRunner bean.

Summary
This implementation demonstrates how to retrieve student information using Hibernate and Spring Data JPA in a Spring Boot application. By defining entity classes, repositories, and optionally a service layer, you can easily fetch and manipulate data from your database. Customize the entity mappings, repository methods, and service logic as per your application's requirements. This approach leverages Spring Boot's auto-configuration and dependency management to streamline database operations. Adjust configurations and expand functionality based on your specific use case and business needs.
