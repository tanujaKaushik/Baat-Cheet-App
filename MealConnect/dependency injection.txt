1. Write a class and implement it using dependency injection. 


Certainly! Here's an example of a class implementing dependency injection:

1. Interface:

Java
public interface MessageService {

  String getMessage();
}
Use code with caution.

2. Concrete Implementation:

Java
public class EmailService implements MessageService {

  @Override
  public String getMessage() {
    return "This is a message sent via email!";
  }
}
Use code with caution.

3. Class with Dependency Injection:

Java
public class NotificationManager {

  private MessageService messageService;

  public NotificationManager(MessageService messageService) {
    this.messageService = messageService;
  }

  public void sendNotification() {
    String message = messageService.getMessage();
    System.out.println("Sending notification: " + message);
  }
}
Use code with caution.

Explanation:

We define an interface MessageService with a getMessage() method.
We create a concrete implementation EmailService that returns a message string.
We define a class NotificationManager with a private field messageService of type MessageService.
The constructor of NotificationManager takes a MessageService object as an argument, allowing dependency injection.
We inject the EmailService instance during object creation, typically using a Spring framework or a custom dependency injection mechanism.
The sendNotification method calls getMessage() on the injected messageService to retrieve the message and print it.
Benefits:

Loose Coupling: NotificationManager doesn't rely on a specific implementation of MessageService.
Flexibility: You can easily switch between different message services (e.g., SMSService) by injecting a different implementation.
Testability: Easier to mock and test NotificationManager with different message services.
