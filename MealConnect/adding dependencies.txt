Here's how to create a Spring Boot application using Spring Initializr with the specified dependencies:

1. Access Spring Initializr:

Go to the Spring Initializr website: https://spring.io/quickstart

2. Project Setup:

In the "Project" section, choose "Maven Project" (or Gradle if preferred).
Select "Java" as the language.
3. Manual Dependencies:

In the "Dependencies" section, expand the search bar and manually add the following dependencies one by one:
Spring Web (for Spring MVC)
Hibernate
Spring Data JPA
Thymeleaf
Spring Boot DevTools
Spring Boot Actuator
4. Database Driver:

Choose the appropriate database driver for your preferred database system from the available options:
For MySQL: mysql-connector-java
For MSSQL: mssql-jdbc
For Oracle: ojdbc
For MongoDB: spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb
5. Generate Project:

Click on the "Generate" button. This will download a zip file containing your Spring Boot project with the specified dependencies.
Additional Notes:

Make sure you replace the database driver name with the exact one corresponding to your chosen database system.
Unzip the downloaded file to a suitable location on your development machine.
You can now import the project into your preferred IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) and start developing your Spring Boot application using Spring MVC, Hibernate, JPA, Thymeleaf, DevTools, and Actuator with the chosen database driver.
Using the Generated Project:

The downloaded project will have a basic structure with pre-configured beans for Spring MVC, Hibernate, and JPA.
You can customize the application by defining your entities, controllers, views (Thymeleaf templates), and services.
DevTools will provide features like hot reloading during development, improving your development workflow.
Actuator can expose various endpoints for monitoring and managing your application.
Remember to configure your database connection details (URL, username, password) in the application properties file (application.properties).
